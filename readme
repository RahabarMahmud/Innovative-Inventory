Hello!
I hope you are doing well.

I have written all the required code for this week's assignment, but unfortunately, I seem to have made some
silly typo somewhere and I have been searching it for the past 48hours. 
It is making my shoppingCartProcess and my formLoginProcess not work. When I login in, 
it shows a blank page with some errors. When I go to shopping cart page, it says that $numRecord is unindexed.
For this reason, I have been unable to check the complete functionality of my site. I have written all the
necessary script, pages and sql file according to sir professor's ones. I also have made all the sql tables and
uploaded them to the server. I am still going through all of my code to find the mistake that I made and
will hopefully try to fix it before you start grading my final website.

I apologise for the inconvenience.

I wish you have a wonderful week ahead of you.
Sincerely,
Rahabar Mahmud
